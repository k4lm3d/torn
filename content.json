It feels like just yesterday that I was stepping onto campus for the first time, filled with dreams and uncertainties. Now, after countless late nights, projects, and moments of self-doubt, I can see the culmination of my hard work approaching. Each course I have taken has contributed to my growth, not just edcationally but personally as well. These skills will undoubtedly serve me well in the future, no matter where my career takes me. As I embark on these final courses, I am reminded of the importance of staying focused and motivated. It‚Äôs easy to feel overwhelmed with the end so close, but I am determined to finish strong. I plan to embrace every moment, and make the most of the resources available to me. * With no perks, there is a total of 147 days left to acquire Bachelor of Computer Science.

I‚Äôm just chilling here at my apartment while writing this. Nothing special, just wanna share my journey at one of the most dangerous cities, Torn City. üè¢ First day, first jobOn my first day, not gonna lie, I‚Äôm actually lost. It‚Äôs a big city, ya know?! I only heard of Torn City on advertisements and on the news. I came here to study and when I got here, the first thing I did was to find a job. I applied for the army but I failed my interview. Then, I applied to a grocery store and fortunately, I got in as a bagger for a salary of $200 a day. The next day, I quit my job and applied again in the army but this time, my interview was a success and I got the job. My salary is -$50 less compared on being a bagger but it‚Äôs fine. I still pressed on. üìö Being a working studentFor my studies, I joined a Computer Science course. I took the first module, CMT1520: Introduction to Computing. I completed it within a week while I‚Äôm in the army. I want to continue the course but my job‚Äôs requiring me to be more physical so I change course. I joined a Self Defence course but I just wanna take the first module, DEF1700: Introduction to Self Defence. I don‚Äôt wanna learn martial arts or sports on the next modules so I change course again soon after I finished it. My next course is a Combat Training course. This time I want to finish it. It has 11 modules. After that, I will go back and finish my first course which is Computer Science. ‚öí My hard work finally payed offAlthough my salary is okay in the army, it‚Äôs not enough so in between my studies and work, I sell some stuff so that I can go to gym and buy new clothes. I also do a lot of missions for George. I met him in the city. It took me 13 days to finished all of that for more money. He is a good friend though. After 12 days in the army, I got a job offer from a Private Security Firm to be a Security Contractor. I‚Äôm so blessed because the salary is $50k a day. It‚Äôs way way more money compared to my daily salary on my previous jobs. I, actually, can‚Äôt believe it but I quit my job and after I got my first day salary at the firm, I‚Äôm super happy. I bought an apartment worth $25k and do some modifications in it&mdash;an upgrade worth $12.5k. Now, I only have to pay $25 daily for the upkeep. Oops! I still want to go on but I need to go to work now. ‚ÄòTill next time üëã","link":"/torn/first-step/"},{"title":"From Battlefield to Bazaar: My Journey as an Army General and Torn Tycoon","text":"Hi again! K4LM3D here. This is gonna be an update post. Again, thank you for passing by, thank you for reading my posts. Hope you‚Äôre doing well in your journey too! This post is still under construction.

I‚Äôm studying while making money to support myself. Aside from my grades, I worry about paying the bills, what to eat and drink, cleaning the house, being healthy and productive, and making profit wherever I go. To be honest, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm able survive everyday. Slowly but surely, I grind and grind to make millions of dollars. I studied about the Points Market and then, bought 25 points. I went to haitus for 46 days and then started to grind again. Yesterday, I withdrawed 3 million from Cayman Island‚Äôs Bank, returned home, and bought 60 points from the Points Market. I exchanged 50 points for a Stock Ticker and I studied about Torn City Stock Exchange. Then today, I bought 400,000+ worth of shares from West Side University. My goal is to buy 1 million shares. That is worth more than 93 million dollars. It gives +10% education course time reduction.","link":"/torn/investing-in-the-stock-market/"},{"title":"I Received Educational Support From Our Faction Leader","text":"I recently had the opportunity to chat with our faction leader, Inf3xshun [2836504]. We discussed about making money, doing business (buy and sell), and making profit through investments. Donator PackFeeling confident in my gameplay, I decided to invest in a donator pack. After consulting with Inf3xshun, I withdrew $20 million from our faction‚Äôs bank and $9 million from Caymans Island‚Äôs Bank. He believed that the donator pack would provide significant benefits and enhance my overall experience. Warring Other Factions: A Profitable StrategyShun also recommended warring other factions as a lucrative way to generate profits. While this strategy involves risks, he emphasized the potential rewards. Now, I‚Äôm more eager to contribute to our faction‚Äôs growth. Investment: Stock Market VenturesBeyond my usual activities, I‚Äôve recently invested in West Side University‚Äôs stock market as I‚Äôve shared on my previous post. This passive income stream aligns with my long-term goals and offers a diversified approach to my finances and education. A Surprising TwistJust when I thought I had a plan, Shun surprised me even further. He sent me a staggering $88 million to invest in West Side University‚Äôs stock market. His reasoning was simple: he wanted to contribute to my education and help me achieve the +10% education time reduction. Returning the FavorWhile I was initially hesitant to accept such a large sum, I realized that Inf3xshun‚Äôs generosity was genuine. I accepted the money, invested in WSU stocks, and returned the excess funds to him. His trust in me was humbling, and I was determined to make the most of this opportunity. Donator Pack and Faction ContributionsWith the funds I withdrew from CIB, I purchased a donator pack from the market. The perks were substantial, including 60 points and various other benefits. To show my gratitude to the faction, I also donated blood bags, medicines, and drugs. Looking AheadWhile my recent purchases have depleted my funds, I‚Äôm excited to see the benefits they bring. I‚Äôll need to grind and make money to replenish my bank account, but I‚Äôm confident that my investments will pay off in the long run. My experience with our leader has been truly inspiring. His generosity and support have strengthened my commitment to our faction and motivated me to strive for greater achievements in Torn City. I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunities and challenges that this virtual world has presented, and I look forward to what the future holds. Thanks for your generosity, Leader Shun!

If you‚Äôre reading this, I just want to say thank you for visiting my blog ^.^ It‚Äôs been awhile since my first post about my journey in Torn City, and a lot of things happened during those times I am away. In this post, we will be doing an update about my work, studies, and so on. If you haven‚Äôt read my previous post yet, I highly recommend that you read it first because there‚Äôs going to be a lot of references in that post. If you‚Äôve already read it, then let‚Äôs go! ü§º Join a faction and find new friendsLast year, on October 14, two days after I published my first Torn post, I received a message from Will. It says that they‚Äôre recruiting a bunch of people for their factions. It‚Äôs up to us if we join or not. If I join, I have to choose from a list of factions, and I chose Orange Chocolate Winter. You may ask why. It is because there are only two people in there at that time, and I want to start with only a few people in a group. Right now, we have 11 people in the faction (including me). They are such welcoming, understanding, and helpful people. And being in a faction is really a blessing because we have a faction bank where we can deposit money and stuff and withdraw or borrow from it. We also help each other during fights, wars, etc. When it comes to socializing, I am lacking. I don‚Äôt talk much most of the time, but when I get to talk, I talk too much. Usually, I listen more, I read more, and I observe more. I hope they don‚Äôt kick me out for that üòÖ üè° Upgraded livingRemember on my previous blog, I said that I was writing it in my apartment? Now, I‚Äôm writing this blog post about my mansion. That‚Äôs right! In my previous work, I‚Äôve gotten a $50k salary daily. I kept 90% of it in my faction‚Äôs bank. Aside from that, I have also done different side jobs for George and an online business. I kept doing that until I could finally buy a mansion. It had a market price of $5 million+ and an upkeep of $500 daily. Inside it, there are a hot tub, a sauna, a large pool, and an open bar. I also spent $1.5 million on superior interior modifications. I live here alone. I didn‚Äôt hire staff yet, so I do the cooking, the cleaning, and all the household chores you can think of! Well, that‚Äôs part of being an independent individual, you know!? I have to get through this for now. My dream is to live on a private island someday with my partner (if there‚Äôs going to be one, but if there‚Äôs none, it‚Äôs fine), and by that time, maybe I can afford to hire staff. üíº Same job, different companyToday, at Torn, is Employee Appreciation Day! Shoutouts to all the employees out there like me. I‚Äôm still working as a security contractor, but for a different firm. I had left Torn for awhile and didn‚Äôt show up on work because of personal reasons. My previous director fired me, but she left me a message saying that if ever I want to come back to work, I can just let her know. When I came back to Torn, I couldn‚Äôt contact her, so I applied to a bunch of firms. I work in the army as a major while waiting for a company to hire me. It took days before I got accepted to a firm with a daily salary of $500,000. That‚Äôs so much bigger than at my previous firm. üéì Courses and chaosIn my previous post, I mentioned that I was taking up a combat training course. When I finished that, I took a Web Design and Development course to open an online business. Then, the Strength and Conditioning course, the Biomechanical Determinants of Skill course, the Nutritional Science course, the Analysis and Performance course, and the Introduction to Biochemistry course. Right now, I‚Äôm taking an intravenous therapy course. It was a course recommended by our faction leader. He said it would help us so much in the war, so I took it up. That‚Äôs it for now, guys. That‚Äôs the update! I‚Äôm sorry it took so long. I‚Äôll post again as soon as I possibly can.
