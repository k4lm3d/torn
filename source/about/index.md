Welcome! My name is **K4LM3D** (/ka:md/) and this is my Torn blog. I write about my experience in there in a role player way.

Thanks for stopping by. I will be posting more gaming related contents and experience here. Hope you stay tuned for updates.

I changed my in-game name/username to **Kalakal**. You can check my post about it [here](/torn/2025-year-in-review-highlights).
