Hello again, citizens of Torn! If you’re reading this, I just want to say thank you for visiting my blog ^.^

It’s been awhile since my [first post](/first-step) about my journey in Torn City, and a lot of things happened during those times I am away. In this post, we will be doing an update about my work, studies, and so on. If you haven’t read my previous post yet, I highly recommend that you read it first because there’s going to be a lot of references in that post. If you’ve already read it, then let’s go!

## 🤼 Join a faction and find new friends
Last year, on October 14, two days after I published my first Torn post, I received a message from **Will**. It says that they’re recruiting a bunch of people for their factions. It’s up to us if we join or not. If I join, I have to choose from a list of factions, and I chose ***<a href="https://www.torn.com/factions.php?step=profile&ID=50662&referredFrom=3035479#/" target="_blank">Orange Chocolate Winter</a>***. You may ask why. It is because there are only two people in there at that time, and I want to start with only a few people in a group. Right now, we have 11 people in the faction (including me). They are such welcoming, understanding, and helpful people. And being in a faction is really a blessing because we have a faction bank where we can deposit money and stuff and withdraw or borrow from it. We also help each other during fights, wars, etc.

When it comes to socializing, I am lacking. I don’t talk much most of the time, but when I get to talk, I talk too much. Usually, I listen more, I read more, and I observe more. I hope they don’t kick me out for that 😅

## 🏡 Upgraded living
Remember on my previous blog, I said that I was writing it in my apartment? Now, I’m writing this blog post about my mansion. That’s right!

In my previous work, I’ve gotten a $50k salary daily. I kept 90% of it in my faction’s bank. Aside from that, I have also done different side jobs for George and an online business. I kept doing that until I could finally buy a mansion. It had a market price of $5 million+ and an upkeep of $500 daily. Inside it, there are a hot tub, a sauna, a large pool, and an open bar. I also spent $1.5 million on superior interior modifications.

I live here alone. I didn’t hire staff yet, so I do the cooking, the cleaning, and all the household chores you can think of! Well, that’s part of being an independent individual, you know!? I have to get through this for now.

My dream is to live on a private island someday with my partner (if there’s going to be one, but if there’s none, it’s fine), and by that time, maybe I can afford to hire staff.

## 💼 Same job, different company
Today, at Torn, is <a href="https://www.torn.com/newspaper.php#!/articles/2573" target="_blank">Employee Appreciation Day</a>! Shoutouts to all the employees out there like me.

I’m still working as a security contractor, but for a different firm. I had left Torn for awhile and didn't show up on work because of personal reasons. My previous director fired me, but she left me a message saying that if ever I want to come back to work, I can just let her know. When I came back to Torn, I couldn’t contact her, so I applied to a bunch of firms. I work in the army as a major while waiting for a company to hire me. It took days before I got accepted to a firm with a daily salary of $500,000. That’s so much bigger than at my previous firm.

## 🎓 Courses and chaos
In my previous post, I mentioned that I was taking up a combat training course. When I finished that, I took a Web Design and Development course to open an online business. Then, the Strength and Conditioning course, the Biomechanical Determinants of Skill course, the Nutritional Science course, the Analysis and Performance course, and the Introduction to Biochemistry course. Right now, I’m taking an intravenous therapy course. It was a course recommended by our faction leader. He said it would help us so much in the war, so I took it up.

That’s it for now, guys. That’s the update! I’m sorry it took so long. I’ll post again as soon as I possibly can. Thank you very much, guys!
