## Introduction

Hello, 👋 I'm **K4LM3D** or *Kal* in some of you but my username in **TORN** is now **Kalakal**. I felt my previous username wasn't suitable in Torn so I changed it.

Anyway, on this post, I'll share some of my 2025 journey and milestones.

## Quarter I: All New

The year began with a push for rank, hitting **Highly Distinguished** in early January. Then after a year of service in **Coursebound Armada [OJCW]** faction, I got promoted from **Navigator** to **First Officer**. 🏴‍☠️

That was a big change for me because I wasn’t just assisting in our operations anymore, I’m also part of the council where I now have the power to vote on the faction’s plans. Aside form that, I became a spy for our leader, **Inf3xshun**. It just happened and we didn't plan it. I'm not going to keep it a secret anymore because there's no reason to hide it, but I won't share any details of it. 😉 So, if need to spy on someone in-game, hire me! *(Joke! I'm retired!)*

On the month of February, **Inf3xshun** sold our faction to **slugginshipley**, one of the council members, because of his health issues IRL. That same month, I reached level 40.

Then, the day of March 20 come when I celebrated my 500th day of service in OJCW faction. That same day I changed my username. *(BTW If you need an active faction, just DM me and I'll recommend you to them.)*

## Quarter II: The Tough Transition

Fast forward on the month of Mayo, I've decided to focus on my real life commitments and stop playing games. It was a tough decision to make but I have to do it coz I don't wanna burden other people both online and offline.

After our failed ranked war, I said goodbye to them but when I'm about to click the leave button, I can't do it so I asked **Josy82**, one of the council, to kick me instead. She kicked me out with this message: *"Goodbye Kal,i hate to do this but you was asking,c u around."* I can't describe that feeling. I'm happy yet it hurts. 😩

After that, of course I didn't play anymore but I was still receiving messages from members of my old faction, and mails from players who wanted to recruit me into their faction/company. Then, I remembered **koolet321**, my former landlord who is actually Filipino and has an all-Filipino faction. *(Hey, Filipinos! 🇵🇭)* To stop receiving recruitment messages, my solution was to join an inactive faction.

**koolet321** said back then that their gang was inactive because they were busy with life, but I could still join. So I messaged her and joined **Philippine Republic [PR]**. *(If you need to rent a Private Island, message her and mention me, she might give you a discount! 😗 Sorry. I'm promoting again 😅)*

## Quarter III: Inactivity and Longevity

I just visit Torn occationally after all of that, especially since I don't always have data. But despite that, I was still promoted to **Chief Justice** in the PR faction and celebrated my two years in Torn. I also maxed out every job rank available in Torn City Jobs. *(Turns out there was no merit for doing that. What a waste 😞)*

## Quarter IV: Social Shift

When November came, **Xythran** and I planned to buy a PI and share it here. It started on September 14 when he found a **Cesium-137** in the City worth more than 500 million.

I proposed and we got married on Nov 18. We invited **Khaelent** as our witness, which he accepted after he landed sa airport  😆 *(It's just that he was the only one active at that time)* and we vowed to share PI. But that time we haven;t have PI, so we shared my mansion for the meantime.

The next day, I reached level 45, and I got a message from **Josy82** congratulating us. 🥰 I was surprised and wondered how she found out, but I assumed **Xythran** told her because he already said goodbye since he was busy in real life and the twice-a-month ranked war in a very active faction was too much hassle.  

**Xythran** left OJCW on Dec 3 to transfer to PR. It took a while due to some issues, so he was able to buy PI on Dec 9.  

Then, just recently on Dec. 27, I finally got the **Spinner** honor. Out of all the awards, this is probably the one I'm most proud of. I mean, you have to spin the roulette wheel a thousand times. Within 2 weeks (1000 / 75 = 13.33), you can get it, but it’s a bit of a drag, so I wasn’t consistent.  

Lastly, just yesterday I won a **Villa** on the **Wheel of Mediocrity** and sold it for $1 million. 🤑
