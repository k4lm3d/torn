Ayo, **K4LM3D** right here. I'm just chilling here at my apartment while writing this. Nothing special, just wanna share my journey at one of the most dangerous cities, Torn City.

## üè¢ First day, first job

On my first day, not gonna lie, I'm actually lost. It's a big city, ya know?! I only heard of Torn City on advertisements and on the news. I came here to study and when I got here, the first thing I did was to find a job.

I applied for the army but I failed my interview. Then, I applied to a grocery store and fortunately, I got in as a bagger for a salary of *$200* a day. The next day, I quit my job and applied again in the army but this time, my interview was a success and I got the job. My salary is *-$50* less compared on being a bagger but it's fine. I still pressed on.

## üìö Being a working student

For my studies, I joined a Computer Science course. I took the first module, `CMT1520: Introduction to Computing`. I completed it within a week while I'm in the army. I want to continue the course but my job's requiring me to be more physical so I change course.

I joined a Self Defence course but I just wanna take the first module, `DEF1700: Introduction to Self Defence`. I don't wanna learn martial arts or sports on the next modules so I change course again soon after I finished it.

My next course is a Combat Training course. This time I want to finish it. It has 11 modules. After that, I will go back and finish my first course which is Computer Science.

## ‚öí My hard work finally payed off

Although my salary is okay in the army, it's not enough so in between my studies and work, I sell some stuff so that I can go to gym and buy new clothes. I also do a lot of missions for **George**. I met him in the city. It took me 13 days to finished all of that for more money. He is a good friend though.

After 12 days in the army, I got a job offer from a **Private Security Firm** to be a **Security Contractor**. I'm so blessed because the salary is *$50k* a day. It's way way more money compared to my daily salary on my previous jobs. I, actually, can't believe it but I quit my job and after I got my first day salary at the firm, I'm super happy. I bought an apartment worth *$25k* and do some modifications in it&mdash;an upgrade worth *$12.5k*. Now, I only have to pay *$25* daily for the upkeep.

Oops! I still want to go on but I need to go to work now. 'Till next time üëã
