As I sit down to write this, I can hardly believe how close I am to achieving a significant milestone in my life: earning a degree. Today, I started my 9th course under <a href="https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Education:Computer_Science" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> education which is *Algorithms And Advanced Programming*. With just 147* days left and only 7 courses to complete, the finish line is finally in sight!

Actually, it should be less than that. A week ago, the curriculum changed. They added to two (2) more courses related to aiding the increase of email frauds (See <a href="https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=1&t=16417770&b=0&a=0" target="_blank">Crimes 2.0: Scamming</a>) which will take 21 days to finish.

> *"Digital crime statistics provided by the Torn City Police Department have revealed that seven out of four people have been financially impacted by an online scam within the past month."*

Reflecting on this journey, I am filled with a mix of emotions&mdash;excitement, anticipation, and a touch of nostalgia. It feels like just yesterday that I was stepping onto campus for the first time, filled with dreams and uncertainties. Now, after countless late nights, projects, and moments of self-doubt, I can see the culmination of my hard work approaching.

Each course I have taken has contributed to my growth, not just edcationally but personally as well. These skills will undoubtedly serve me well in the future, no matter where my career takes me.

As I embark on these final courses, I am reminded of the importance of staying focused and motivated. It's easy to feel overwhelmed with the end so close, but I am determined to finish strong. I plan to embrace every moment, and make the most of the resources available to me.

      <strong>*</strong> With no perks, there is a total of 147 days left to acquire Bachelor of Computer Science.

      Of course, it is different with perks. Actually, I spend 10 merits on Education Length which gives +10% education length reduction. Also, I'm promoted to the top rank of the job Education (Principal) which gives a passive +10% course time reduction.
